# Project Title: Cement Demand Forecasting Dashboard
# Overview
This project is a data analytics and machine learning solution for forecasting cement demand over time. Built using Streamlit, the dashboard offers an interactive web interface for visualizing past trends, exploring key metrics, and predicting future demand. The insights provided can help manufacturers, distributors, and planners in the construction industry make data-driven decisions regarding production and sales.

# Key Features
Interactive Dashboard UI: Built using Streamlit, offering easy navigation between dashboard and prediction views.

# Descriptive Analytics:

Average, peak, and median demand statistics.

Total production and average sales metrics.

Best and worst performing months in terms of demand.

# Visual Insights:

Line plots comparing Demand, Production, and Sales over time.

Forecasted demand vs historical trends with an intuitive visual interface.

# Forecasting:

Uses machine learning models (e.g., XGBoost or Scikit-learn regressors) to predict future cement demand.

Forecast plot shows projected demand for upcoming months alongside historical data.

# Technologies Used
Frontend & Visualization: Streamlit, Plotly, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Backend & Data Processing: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost

Forecasting Model: Time series regression using XGBoost

Data Source: Uploaded CSV file containing historical cement demand, production, and sales data.
